# Discord Delivery

Delivers messages to your read-only information channels.

## Motivation

Discord servers typically have read-only channels regarding information about the server. An example would be the rules of the server. The issue is that messages are authored by one user, which means only that user may edit that message (or you would have to delete that message and send the updated version).

With Discord Delivery, you have an option. As long as you supply a Discord application token alongiside your information channels with existing message ids, they will be updated. No need to wait for someone to become available since anyone would be able to propose a change.
